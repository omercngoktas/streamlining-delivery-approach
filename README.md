# Streamlining Delivery Approach

## Overview

This project focuses on optimizing delivery routes using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and real-time traffic data. By leveraging Selenium with multiprocessing, we fetch up-to-date traffic conditions and estimated arrival times, ensuring the routes are optimized based on current traffic situations.

## Project Background

### Ant Colony Optimization

Ant Colony Optimization is a bio-inspired algorithm that mimics the foraging behavior of ants. It's particularly effective for solving combinatorial optimization problems like the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), which is fundamental to route optimization. In our project, we utilize ACO to find the shortest and most efficient delivery routes.

### Real-Time Traffic Data

To enhance the accuracy of our route optimization, we use Selenium to scrape real-time traffic data from Google Maps. By incorporating multiprocessing, we can efficiently handle multiple data-fetching processes simultaneously, ensuring that our traffic data is both current and comprehensive.

## Real-World Application

This project is not only a thesis but also prepared for a company seeking to streamline its delivery operations. Traditionally, delivery routes were planned manually using paper maps, which often led to suboptimal and lengthy routes. Human planners could only estimate traffic conditions, leading to inefficiencies.

### Optimization Achievements

Through our optimization efforts, we have significantly improved route efficiency. Previously, routes planned manually could be as long as 770 kilometers. With our algorithm, we have managed to reduce this to approximately 590 kilometers, demonstrating a substantial improvement in delivery efficiency.

## Route Visualizations

We have created visual representations of the optimized routes for each truck. These images illustrate the effectiveness of our approach by showing the streamlined paths.

## Benefits and Impact

- **Efficiency:** Our optimized routes save time and reduce fuel consumption, contributing to cost savings.
- **Accuracy:** By using real-time traffic data, our routes adapt to current conditions, ensuring timely deliveries.
- **Scalability:** The approach can handle large-scale route planning, making it suitable for companies with extensive delivery networks.

## Conclusion

This project showcases the potential of Ant Colony Optimization with real-time data fetching to solve practical problems. By automating and optimizing the route planning process, we not only improve efficiency but also provide a scalable solution for the logistics industry.
